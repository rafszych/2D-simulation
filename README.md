# 2D-simulation

A little overblown simulation of collision of particles in 2-Dimensions. Randomly assigns starting point, size (corresponding to mass) and velocity of each particle.
Created in order to learn dynamic memory allocation, lists and visualization in C.

This is a work in progress. Collisions are not yet perfect - sometimes particles fly through each other and there are some issues with incorrect direction change after collision.
