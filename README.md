# 2D-simulation

A little overblown simulation of collision of particles in 2-Dimensions. Randomly assigns starting point, size (corresponding to mass) and velocity of each particle.
Created in order to learn dynamic memory allocation and lists in C.

Collisions are not yet perfect - there are some issues with direction change after collision and soetimes particles get stuck to eachother.
