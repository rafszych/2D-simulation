# 2D-simulation

A little overblown simulation of collision of particles in 2-Dimensions. Randomly assigns starting point, size (corresponding to mass) and velocity of each particle.
Created in order to learn dynamic memory allocation, pointers and lists in C.


Collisions are not yet perfect - there are some issues with direction change after collision and soetimes particles get stuck to eachother.
